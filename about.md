Hi, visitor! Thanks for reading my page.

My name is Xiang Zhang.
I am a former [NEET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEET), former programmer and novice researcher.

I've ever worked in [DidiTaxi](http://www.xiaojukeji.com/) and [Tencent](http://www.tencent.com/).

My previous work includes indexing, searching and recommendation on (geographic) POIs, and ranking optimization for geographic queries in our search engine.   
I also wrote some strategies in our product operation activities, for instance, the randomized amount of coupon in a taxi red envelope.

I'm interested in machine learning, natural language processing and math. I like using Python and C++ both.

The title of this blog comes from the lyric of `Hemisphere`, a piece of perfect work by Yoko Kanno and Maaya Sakamoto.

Very glad to communicate with you all.
