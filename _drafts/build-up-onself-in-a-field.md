I've talked to my new leader today and we discussed several questions. I found some new ideas to me which may be helpful.

I've ever tried to go back to academia. I think it's a good way for a man to make progress and build up a solid background in a specified field. I still think it's correct. But along this route, some people fail while a small group of people succeed. It is necessary to think about what leads the difference.

People get tired after work, of course. But it can not be said that time is used up. Spare out one hour or so every day is not that hard. Use this regular time to read and accumulate.
