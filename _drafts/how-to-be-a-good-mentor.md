As I have experienced before, a good mentor is important for a new employee, especially for the undergraduated who just come out from school and join the work force. Different from that we learn by ourselves, to be a mentor for someone and give him advice and support is another difficult problem. I've also asked several of my friends, they give me some of their experience as a mentor. When it comes to me, I think it's useful to write things down to record the way to be a good mentor. Because of my work, I mainly refer to the mentor in an IT company.

To interview candidate

It may be useful if you have chance to interview your candidate. Although this is somewhat far from the topic here, I think it's useful to communicate with these candidate before he finally become your intern or colleague.

Make sure the candidate matches the job you are hiring or he have the ability to do what you want him to do. And more importantly, let him know what you are doing, too. Do not hide or exaggerate anything as long as it's not classified.

Tell him the big picture first
----

Real work is full of details, of course. But they must not be presented at the very beginning. As we are convinced he knows the essential skills for the job, we are not in that hurry to let him do the work. And I've also met some mentor who assign small project to new people, which may depend less on other modules and is suitable for one to start. But, still, we are not in that hurry.

Tell him the big picture for our work. Start from the main business of our work. What the architecture is simply like, what resources do we have, and what things are covered by our team or other teams' work. People can easily understand problems from the top-down view.

Use simple words, and also let him know you are not skipping important things, they are just not the key point.

People are different. Different ideas will come out when the same thing comes to different people, especially for those who just start to think about the problem. He may not follow you and needs one or two times of repeat. He maybe won't follow you because he has another way of thought. As a mentor and colleague, accept the difference.
